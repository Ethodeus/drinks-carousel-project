## How It's Made:

This was my first attempt working with APIs, decided to add some styling and interaction to the cards that were created through the API request by populating 
divs located inside a this basic carousel I found on [swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/).

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to populate divs with the ```innerHTML``` element property. Although it is not considered best practice, it helped me understand the basics of this concept, and will be looking for alternative ways to do that with future projects.
